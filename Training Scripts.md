🎥 SHORT TRAINING SCRIPTS (FINAL)
🎥 SCRIPT 1 — DOCTOR TRAINING (3 minutes)

Title: “How to Treat Patients Safely Using AfyaLink”

Hello Doctor,
This system is designed to protect you, the patient, and the hospital.

Here are three rules to remember:

Rule one:
If a button is disabled, do not try to bypass it.
The system is preventing a medical or legal error.

Rule two:
Follow the workflow in order:
Triage → Diagnosis → Labs → Prescription → Insurance → Care.

You cannot skip steps — this protects you from insurance rejection and legal risk.

Rule three:
Everything you write is permanent and auditable.
Write notes as if a lawyer will read them — because one day, they might.

If insurance is pending or rejected, stop and wait.
Emergency care is allowed — everything else must wait.

Thank you for practicing safe, compliant medicine.

🎥 SCRIPT 2 — LAB STAFF TRAINING (2 minutes)

Title: “Lab Workflow Safety”

Hello Lab Team,

Only act when the system shows LAB PENDING.

Do not:

Complete labs early

Edit results after completion

Perform tests outside the system

Every lab action is linked to a patient, a doctor, and an audit log.

If the button is disabled, it means:

The doctor is not ready

Insurance is not approved

Or the workflow is protecting you

When in doubt — stop and ask.

🎥 SCRIPT 3 — PHARMACY TRAINING (2 minutes)

Title: “Safe & Legal Dispensing”

Hello Pharmacy Team,

Dispense medication only when the system allows it.

You must see:

Prescription ready

Insurance approved

Dispense button enabled

Never dispense:

Without approval

Outside the system

Based on verbal instructions

Every dispense action is legally traceable.

The system protects you — trust it.

🎥 SCRIPT 4 — BILLING / CASHIER TRAINING (2 minutes)

Title: “Payments & Compliance”

Hello Billing Team,

All payments must go through the system.

Never:

Accept off-system payments

Mark payments as paid manually

Reuse old receipts

If payment fails:

Retry through the system

Do not improvise

Every payment is tied to:

A patient

An encounter

An audit trail

This protects you and the hospital.

🎥 SCRIPT 5 — ADMIN TRAINING (4 minutes)

Title: “Admin Power & Responsibility”

Hello Admin,

You have the highest level of system access.

Every admin action is:

Logged

Timestamped

Irreversible

Before approving or rejecting insurance:
Ask yourself:

“Would I defend this decision in court?”

If the answer is no — do not proceed.

Never:

Edit audit logs

Override without justification

Share admin accounts

Your role is to protect the hospital, not to speed things up.

🎥 SCRIPT 6 — INCIDENT RESPONSE (1 minute)

Title: “When Something Goes Wrong”

If the system blocks you:

Stop

Take a screenshot

Inform admin

Do not bypass

If insurance systems are down:

Emergency care continues

Admin documents exception

Workflow protects staff

Never panic — the system is designed for this.
