DOCTOR & ADMIN TRAINING GUIDE

(Prevents 90% of real-world system failures)

This guide is written so non-technical staff cannot accidentally break workflows, insurance, or legal records.

🎯 TRAINING GOALS

By the end of training, staff must:

Follow workflow order

Understand why buttons are disabled

Know when NOT to proceed

Understand audit & legal consequences

🩺 A. DOCTOR TRAINING
🔹 Core Rule (Memorize This)

“If the button is disabled, the system is protecting you.”

Never ask IT to bypass workflow.

1️⃣ Doctor Workflow (Golden Path)

Open Encounter

Triage patient

Diagnose

Request labs (if needed)

Prescribe

Submit for insurance (SHA)

Wait for approval

Continue care

❌ Skipping steps = blocked by design

2️⃣ What Doctors SHOULD NEVER Do
Action	Why
Proceed without SHA approval	Illegal billing
Share login	Legal liability
Edit past notes	Audit violation
Ask admin to “just unlock”	Logged & reviewed
3️⃣ Workflow Badges (Quick Meaning)
Color	Meaning
🟡 Orange	Waiting (SHA, payment, lab)
🟢 Green	Approved / Completed
🔴 Red	Rejected / Blocked
🔵 Blue	Clinical in progress

If you see red → stop.

4️⃣ Medical Reports (Legal Records)

Every note is time-stamped

Every change is logged

Reports may be used in:

Court

Insurance disputes

Medical boards

🧠 Write as if a lawyer will read it.

🧪 B. LAB STAFF TRAINING
Lab Rules

Only act when:

Workflow shows LAB_PENDING

Never complete lab early

Never edit results after completion

❌ Early completion = clinical risk

💊 C. PHARMACY TRAINING
Pharmacy Rules

Dispense ONLY when:

SHA approved

Prescription ready

One dispense per prescription

Never override dosage

🧠 Dispensing is legally traceable.

🧾 D. BILLING / CASHIER TRAINING
Payment Rules

Never accept payment outside system

Never mark paid manually

Stripe / M-Pesa only

If payment fails → retry via system

🛡️ E. ADMIN TRAINING (MOST IMPORTANT)
Admin Power = Legal Responsibility

Admin actions:

Override insurance

Force approve / reject

View audits

View KPIs

Admin Golden Rule

Every override must survive court review.

Admin Override Checklist

Before clicking Approve / Reject:

Read justification aloud

Ask: “Would this stand in court?”

If unsure → DON’T CLICK

Overrides are:
✔ Logged
✔ Timestamped
✔ Irreversible

🚨 What Admins Must NEVER Do
Action	Consequence
Delete audit logs	Criminal offense
Edit workflow history	Evidence tampering
Approve without justification	Legal exposure
Share admin login	Termination-level
📊 F. KPI DASHBOARD — HOW TO USE

Admins check daily:

SHA pending count

Lab delays

Pharmacy backlog

Payment pending

KPIs are:
📈 Early warnings
📉 Risk indicators

🧠 G. INCIDENT RESPONSE (ALL STAFF)
If system blocks action:

Stop

Screenshot error

Inform admin

Do NOT bypass

If SHA is down:

System blocks automatically

Continue emergency care

Admin documents exception

🏁 FINAL TRAINING RULE

The system is not slow — it is compliant.

Speed without compliance = lawsuits.
