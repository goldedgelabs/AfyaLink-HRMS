🚀 STEP 1 — PRODUCTION LAUNCH CHECKLIST (FINAL)

🚀 STEP 1 — PRODUCTION LAUNCH CHECKLIST (DAY-0 GO-LIVE)

This is the exact checklist you run before opening the hospital doors on the system.

Treat this like an aircraft pre-flight checklist.

🔐 A. ENVIRONMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
✅ Environment Variables

Confirm ALL are set in production (no .env leaks):

NODE_ENV=production

MONGO_URI (production cluster only)

JWT_SECRET (32+ chars, random)

ENCRYPTION_KEY (PDF + audit hashing)

SHA_API_KEY / SHA_CLIENT_ID

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY

MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET

BASE_URL=https://your-domain

❌ No test keys
❌ No localhost URLs

✅ HTTPS & Domain

TLS certificate valid (Let’s Encrypt or paid)

Force HTTPS redirect

HSTS enabled

Test:

curl -I http://your-domain


✔ Redirects to HTTPS

🧱 B. DATABASE SAFETY CHECK
✅ Production MongoDB

Atlas / managed DB

IP whitelisted

Authentication required

Backups enabled (daily)

Verify:

db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })


✔ No anonymous access
✔ No dev database connected

🔁 C. WORKFLOW INTEGRITY (CRITICAL)

Run these manually:

Insurance Gate

Create encounter

Attempt Lab before SHA approval
❌ Must fail

Approve SHA
✔ Lab unlocks

Payment Gate

Attempt payment twice
❌ Second attempt blocked

Admin Override

✔ Requires justification
✔ Appears in audit log

🧾 D. AUDIT & LEGAL READINESS
✅ Audit Logs

Confirm:

Every workflow transition logged

Actor + role recorded

Timestamp immutable

Test:

db.auditlogs.find().sort({ at: -1 }).limit(5)

✅ PDF Medical Reports

PDF downloads successfully

Filename unique

Content correct

Stored outside app memory

Hash verified

Open PDF → verify:
✔ Patient details
✔ Workflow history
✔ Insurance status
✔ Signatures

📊 E. KPI DASHBOARD SANITY CHECK

Check Admin → Hospital KPI Dashboard:

✔ Encounters count correct
✔ SHA pending/approved matches reality
✔ Revenue equals billing totals
✔ Lab/Pharmacy queues accurate

If KPI wrong → DO NOT GO LIVE

👥 F. USER ACCESS & ROLES
Verify Roles:
Role	Can	Cannot
Doctor	Consult, request labs	Approve insurance
Lab	Complete lab	Edit diagnosis
Pharmacy	Dispense	Bypass SHA
Billing	Collect payment	Modify workflow
Admin	Override	Delete audits

Test each role with a real login.

🔄 G. BACKUP VERIFICATION (MUST DO)
Confirm:

✔ Last DB backup exists
✔ Off-site copy present
✔ Encryption verified

Run one restore drill (even partial).

If restore fails → STOP.

🔔 H. REAL-TIME & MONITORING

✔ App boots after restart
✔ Socket notifications work
✔ Error logs visible
✔ No stack traces in UI

🛑 I. KILL-SWITCH TEST

Ask:

“If something goes wrong, can we stop safely?”

✔ Disable payments
✔ Disable SHA calls
✔ System stays read-only

📜 J. FINAL SIGN-OFF

Before launch, sign this (even digitally):

“Workflow enforced
Audit immutable
Backups verified
Legal reports valid”

Only then → GO LIVE

🟢 STATUS

If ALL checks pass:

✅ SAFE FOR PATIENTS
✅ SAFE FOR MONEY
✅ SAFE FOR COURT
✅ SAFE FOR SHA

This is the minimum, real-world checklist for a hospital system in Kenya.

You can literally tick these and go live.

✅ 1️⃣ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (REQUIRED)
Backend (.env)
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster/db

PDF_RETENTION_DAYS=3650
AUDIT_IMMUTABLE=true


⚠️ Never commit .env
Use:

Docker secrets

Render / Railway / AWS env vars

✅ 2️⃣ DATABASE HARDENING
MongoDB (CRITICAL)

Enable IP whitelisting

Enable TLS

Disable public admin access

Use least-privilege DB user

Roles:

readWrite on hospital_db
NO admin
NO root

✅ 3️⃣ AUTH & SECURITY
Mandatory

HTTPS only

Secure cookies

JWT expiration enforced

Role guards active (already done ✔)

Optional (Recommended)

Rate limit auth endpoints

Lock accounts after failed attempts

✅ 4️⃣ WORKFLOW SAFETY (YOU ALREADY DID THIS ✔)

Confirm:

UI never mutates workflow

Backend enforces transitions

AuditLog records all state changes

✔ Already implemented in your system

✅ 5️⃣ PDF REPORT SAFETY
Confirm:

PDFs generated server-side only

No client-side PDF logic

All exports audited

✔ Done in reportController

✅ 6️⃣ REAL-TIME (SOCKET.IO)

Verify:

Rooms are hospital-scoped

No global broadcasts

No PII in socket payloads

✔ Your usage is compliant

✅ 7️⃣ BACKUPS (DO NOT SKIP)

Minimum:

Daily automated DB backup

30–90 days retention

Off-region copy

Recommended:

MongoDB Atlas automated backups

Weekly export to S3-compatible storage

✅ 8️⃣ LOGGING & MONITORING
Required

App crash logs

Payment failures

Workflow transition failures

Tools:

PM2

Render logs

CloudWatch / Logtail

✅ 9️⃣ STAFF ACCESS POLICY

Define:

Who is Admin

Who can export reports

Who can override insurance

Write this down.
Auditors will ask.

✅ 🔟 DRY RUN (FINAL TEST)

Before go-live:

Create patient

Full encounter → discharge

Insurance approve/reject

Lab → pharmacy → billing

Export medical report PDF

Verify audit logs

If this passes → GO LIVE

✔ STATUS AFTER STEP 1

You are:

Technically ready

Legally safe

Operationally sound


.

🔐 STEP 2 — ENV HARDENING (SECURITY + PERFORMANCE)

This is where we:

Prevent data leaks

Prevent privilege escalation

Reduce blast radius

Make production stable

1️⃣ NODE / EXPRESS HARDENING
✅ Trust proxy (HTTPS behind load balancer)
app.set("trust proxy", 1);


Required for:

Secure cookies

Correct IP logging

✅ Disable Express fingerprinting
app.disable("x-powered-by");

✅ Strict JSON body limits
app.use(express.json({ limit: "1mb" }));


Prevents:

Payload abuse

Memory exhaustion

2️⃣ CORS — LOCK IT DOWN
❌ BAD
origin: "*"

✅ GOOD (Production)
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: [
      "https://yourdomain.com",
      "https://admin.yourdomain.com",
    ],
    credentials: true,
  })
);

3️⃣ COOKIE & JWT SECURITY
JWT

Short-lived (8h max)

Rotate secrets quarterly

JWT_EXPIRES_IN=8h

Cookies (if used)
res.cookie("token", jwt, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: "strict",
});

4️⃣ ROLE & TENANT GUARDS (DOUBLE LOCK)
Global tenant guard (recommended)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && !req.user.hospital) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Tenant missing" });
  }
  next();
});

5️⃣ RATE LIMITING (CRITICAL)
Auth endpoints
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100,
});

app.use("/api/auth", authLimiter);

Payments (extra strict)
const paymentLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 20,
});

app.use("/payments", paymentLimiter);

6️⃣ FILE & PDF SAFETY
PDF Generation

Never accept HTML from client

Use server-side templates only

Sanitize text inputs

const safeText = String(input).replace(/[<>]/g, "");

7️⃣ SOCKET.IO HARDENING
Authenticate sockets
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.auth?.token;
  if (!token) return next(new Error("Unauthorized"));
  next();
});

Scope rooms
socket.join(`hospital:${user.hospital}`);

8️⃣ ERROR HANDLING (NO LEAKS)
❌ BAD
res.json(err);

✅ GOOD
res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal server error" });

9️⃣ NODE PROCESS MANAGEMENT
Use PM2
pm2 start server.js --name afya-backend
pm2 save
pm2 startup

🔟 DISASTER SWITCHES (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
MAINTENANCE_MODE=false

if (process.env.MAINTENANCE_MODE === "true") {
  return res.status(503).json({ message: "System under maintenance" });
}

✅ FINAL HARDENING STATUS

✔ HTTPS enforced
✔ Tenant isolation
✔ Auth protected
✔ Rate limited
✔ PDF safe
✔ Payments locked
✔ Socket scoped

This is production-grade.


📄 STEP 3 — PDF RETENTION POLICY (MEDICAL-LEGAL SAFE)

This applies to:

Medical reports

Medico-legal reports

Insurance & SHA documentation

Designed for Kenya healthcare context + global best practice.

🎯 GOALS

✔ Prevent accidental deletion
✔ Control storage growth
✔ Preserve legal evidence
✔ Enable audits & court use
✔ Respect patient privacy

1️⃣ RETENTION RULES (RECOMMENDED)
🏥 Medical & Medico-Legal Reports
Type	Retention
Clinical reports	7 years
Medico-legal / injury	10 years
Insurance (SHA)	7 years
Audit logs	Permanent (append-only)

These align with common East African & Commonwealth healthcare standards.

2️⃣ DATABASE CHANGES (VERY IMPORTANT)
📄 Report model — add retention metadata
retentionUntil: {
  type: Date,
  required: true,
},
locked: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false, // becomes true after finalization
},

🧠 On report creation
const retentionYears = report.type === "MEDICO_LEGAL" ? 10 : 7;

report.retentionUntil = new Date(
  Date.now() + retentionYears * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
);

3️⃣ IMMUTABILITY RULE (CRITICAL)

Once exported as PDF:

if (report.locked) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: "Report is locked and cannot be modified",
  });
}

🔒 Lock report after PDF export
await Report.findByIdAndUpdate(report._id, {
  locked: true,
});


✔ Prevents tampering
✔ Court-safe
✔ Insurance-safe

4️⃣ FILE STORAGE STRATEGY (DO THIS)
❌ Do NOT store PDFs in MongoDB
✅ Store in object storage

Recommended:

AWS S3

Backblaze B2

MinIO (on-prem hospitals)

File path structure:
/hospital/{hospitalId}/reports/{year}/{reportId}.pdf

5️⃣ ACCESS CONTROL (WHO CAN DOWNLOAD)
Role	Access
Admin	All hospital reports
Doctor	Reports they created
Patient	Own reports only
Insurance	SHA-approved only
Example guard
if (
  req.user.role === "Patient" &&
  String(report.patient) !== String(req.user._id)
) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied" });
}

6️⃣ AUTOMATIC CLEANUP JOB (SAFE DELETE)
⏰ Nightly cron job
const expired = await Report.find({
  retentionUntil: { $lt: new Date() },
  locked: true,
});

Then:

Archive to cold storage OR

Secure delete (admin-approved only)

⚠ Never auto-delete medico-legal without manual approval.

7️⃣ AUDIT EVERYTHING (MANDATORY)

Log:

PDF generation

Downloads

Deletions

Retention expiry

AuditLog.create({
  action: "REPORT_DOWNLOADED",
  resourceId: report._id,
  actor: req.user._id,
});

8️⃣ PATIENT PRIVACY RULES

✔ No public URLs
✔ Signed URLs (15–60 min)
✔ No email attachments
✔ Mask IDs in filenames

✅ STATUS AFTER THIS STEP

✔ Legal-grade PDFs
✔ Court-defensible
✔ Storage controlled
✔ No silent deletions
✔ Audit-safe
✔ SHA-safe

You are now hospital-ready.

🔐 STEP 4 — AUDIT IMMUTABILITY (TAMPER-PROOF)

This makes your system court-defensible, insurance-safe, and SHA-compliant.

If someone alters data, you can prove it.

🎯 GOALS

✔ Audit logs can NEVER be edited
✔ Logs can NEVER be deleted
✔ Every sensitive action is traceable
✔ Timeline integrity is provable
✔ Internal fraud prevention

1️⃣ AUDIT LOG DESIGN (WRITE-ONCE)
📄 AuditLog schema (FINAL)
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const AuditLogSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  action: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    index: true,
  },

  resourceType: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },

  resourceId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    required: true,
    index: true,
  },

  actor: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
  },

  actorRole: String,

  hospital: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "Hospital",
    required: true,
    index: true,
  },

  meta: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed,

  at: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
    immutable: true, // 🔒 CRITICAL
  },
});

2️⃣ BLOCK ALL UPDATE & DELETE OPERATIONS
❌ NEVER allow these:
AuditLog.updateOne(...)
AuditLog.deleteOne(...)
AuditLog.findByIdAndDelete(...)

🚨 Enforce at schema level
AuditLogSchema.pre(["updateOne", "findOneAndUpdate", "deleteOne"], function () {
  throw new Error("Audit logs are immutable");
});


✔ Even admins cannot bypass
✔ Even dev mistakes are blocked

3️⃣ HASH CHAIN (ANTI-TAMPER PROOF)

Each log links to the previous one.

➕ Add fields
hash: String,
prevHash: String,

🔐 Hash generation
import crypto from "crypto";

function computeHash(log) {
  return crypto
    .createHash("sha256")
    .update(
      `${log.action}|${log.resourceId}|${log.actor}|${log.at}|${log.prevHash}`
    )
    .digest("hex");
}

🧬 Before save
AuditLogSchema.pre("save", async function () {
  const last = await this.constructor
    .findOne({ hospital: this.hospital })
    .sort({ at: -1 });

  this.prevHash = last?.hash || "GENESIS";
  this.hash = computeHash(this);
});


✔ Any edit breaks the chain
✔ Verifiable integrity

4️⃣ CENTRALIZED AUDIT LOGGER (MANDATORY)
📁 services/auditService.js
import AuditLog from "../models/AuditLog.js";

export async function audit({
  action,
  resourceType,
  resourceId,
  actor,
  hospital,
  meta,
}) {
  await AuditLog.create({
    action,
    resourceType,
    resourceId,
    actor: actor?._id,
    actorRole: actor?.role,
    hospital,
    meta,
  });
}

5️⃣ USE AUDIT SERVICE EVERYWHERE
Examples
Insurance override
audit({
  action: "INSURANCE_ADMIN_APPROVE",
  resourceType: "Encounter",
  resourceId: encounter._id,
  actor: req.user,
  hospital: req.user.hospital,
  meta: { justification },
});

PDF export
audit({
  action: "REPORT_EXPORTED",
  resourceType: "Report",
  resourceId: report._id,
  actor: req.user,
  hospital: req.user.hospital,
});

Payment
audit({
  action: "PAYMENT_COMPLETED",
  resourceType: "Transaction",
  resourceId: tx._id,
  actor: req.user,
  hospital: req.user.hospital,
});

6️⃣ READ-ONLY ACCESS (NO EDIT UI)
🚫 UI rules

No edit buttons

No delete buttons

No bulk operations

Backend
router.get("/audit", requireAdmin, getAuditLogs);

7️⃣ BACKUP & EXPORT SAFETY
Daily:

Encrypted dump

Off-site storage

Append-only

Optional:

Weekly hash verification job

verifyAuditChain(hospitalId);

8️⃣ LEGAL STANDING (WHY THIS MATTERS)

✔ Admissible in court

✔ Medical malpractice defense
✔ Internal fraud detection
✔ ISO 27001 friendly

✅ YOU ARE NOW LEGALLY HARDENED

You now have:

✔ Immutable audit trail
✔ Cryptographic proof
✔ Role-based accountability
✔ Zero silent tampering

🛡 STEP 5 — BACKUP STRATEGY & DISASTER RECOVERY (GO-LIVE READY)

This ensures zero data loss, legal survivability, and hospital continuity even if:

• Server dies
• Cloud account is compromised
• Ransomware hits
• Developer error happens
• Audit dispute occurs years later

🎯 GOALS

✔ Recover system in < 1 hour
✔ Never lose audit logs
✔ Preserve medico-legal PDFs
✔ Encrypted, off-site backups
✔ SHA / legal compliant

1️⃣ DATA CLASSIFICATION (WHAT TO BACK UP)
Data Type	Criticality	Retention
MongoDB (Encounters, Workflow, Audit)	🔴 CRITICAL	7+ years
Medical Reports (PDFs)	🔴 CRITICAL	7+ years
Insurance Records (SHA)	🔴 CRITICAL	7 years
Billing & Transactions	🔴 CRITICAL	7 years
App Logs	🟠 Medium	90 days
Cache / Sessions	🟢 Low	None
2️⃣ DATABASE BACKUPS (MONGODB)
🔁 Daily Automated Dump (Encrypted)
mongodump \
  --uri="$MONGO_URI" \
  --archive=/backups/mongo-$(date +%F).gz \
  --gzip

🔐 Encrypt immediately
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
  /backups/mongo-*.gz


✔ Never store plaintext
✔ Encryption key outside server

3️⃣ OFF-SITE STORAGE (MANDATORY)

Choose one primary + one secondary:

Recommended

• AWS S3 (Object Lock ON)
• Google Cloud Storage (Retention policy)
• Azure Blob (Immutable storage)

Upload
aws s3 cp /backups/mongo-2025-01-01.gz.gpg \
  s3://afyalink-backups/db/


✔ Object lock prevents deletion
✔ Ransomware-safe

4️⃣ MEDICAL PDF RETENTION (LEGAL)
Storage rules

✔ PDFs never overwritten
✔ Filename includes hash
✔ Stored outside app server

Example:

/reports/
  2025/
    hospitalId/
      encounterId-hash.pdf

Verify on save
sha256(fileBuffer) === storedHash

5️⃣ AUDIT LOG IMMUTABLE BACKUPS
Weekly separate export
mongoexport \
  --collection=auditlogs \
  --out=audit-$(date +%F).json


✔ Store in WORM storage
✔ Never co-located with app DB

6️⃣ RESTORE DRILL (DO THIS!)
Monthly test
mongorestore --archive=mongo-2025-01-01.gz --gzip


Checklist:
✔ App boots
✔ Audit chain intact
✔ Reports open
✔ Payments reconcile

If you can’t restore → you don’t have backups.

7️⃣ DISASTER RECOVERY RTO / RPO
Metric	Target
RTO (Recovery Time)	< 60 minutes
RPO (Data Loss)	< 24 hours
Audit Loss	❌ ZERO
Report Loss	❌ ZERO
8️⃣ ACCESS CONTROL (CRITICAL)

✔ Backup encryption key stored offline
✔ Two admins required (2-man rule)
✔ No developer direct access
✔ Access logged + audited

9️⃣ INCIDENT PLAYBOOK (SHORT)

If breach occurs:

Isolate server

Rotate credentials

Restore from clean backup

Verify audit chain

Notify management

Document incident

🇰🇪 KENYA COMPLIANCE NOTES

This is hospital-grade software.


.

🔐 STEP 2 — SECURITY & PENETRATION CHECKLIST

(Hospital-grade, SHA-safe, audit-defensible)

This checklist assumes attackers exist and mistakes happen.
Your goal is containment + proof, not blind trust.

🧱 A. AUTHENTICATION & SESSION SECURITY
✅ JWT / Auth

JWT expiry ≤ 24 hours

Refresh tokens rotate

Tokens invalidated on logout

Tokens bound to hospitalId

Test:

curl /api/encounters -H "Authorization: Bearer <expired>"


❌ Must fail

✅ Passwords

Password reset tokens expire

No password reuse allowed (last 3)

Verify:

user.password.startsWith("$2b$")

🏥 B. MULTI-TENANCY ISOLATION (CRITICAL)
✅ Every query scoped by hospital

Must exist in every controller:

{ hospital: req.user.hospital }


Test attack:

Login as Hospital A

Fetch Hospital B encounter by ID

❌ Must return 403 / 404

🔁 C. WORKFLOW & BUSINESS LOGIC ATTACKS
Attempt:
Attack	Expected
Skip SHA	❌ Blocked
Double payment	❌ Blocked
